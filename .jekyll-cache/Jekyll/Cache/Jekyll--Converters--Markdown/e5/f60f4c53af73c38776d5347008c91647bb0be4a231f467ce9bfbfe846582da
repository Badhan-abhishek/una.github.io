I"Y<p>The keyboard, where our hands are placed most of the time (as developers), is the fastest navigation method by default. I always think devs look so slick and badass when navigating their systems without touching their trackpad/mouse. They’re like little ninjas — slick, fast and know how to move with ease.</p>

<p>If you’re not convinced yet, let’s break it down:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Performance optimization — you care about it on your projects. Why not care about it in your workflow?</li>
  <li>Switching between tabs and windows and a keyboard and mouse is clunky and error-prone and fumbly. Like runon sentances.</li>
  <li>You’ll look like you know what you’re doing. (Isn’t that reason enough? :P)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-sticky-note-method">The Sticky Note Method</h2>

<p><a class="twitter-share">If you want to become a keyboard ninja, try putting a sticky note (or two) on the top of your trackpad.</a> Why? because a few things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It will remind you not to use it, causing you to Google alternative navigation flows (you’ll learn a lot this way)</li>
  <li>You can still easily access the trackpad by simply lifting the sticky note from below or on the edge (where you’d be accessing it anyway)</li>
</ol>

<p>Make sure to write down new shortcuts you learn on that sticky note — use a felt tip pen so you don’t need press too hard and accidentally click on something.
<br />
When you’ve covered your sticky with shortcut reminders, put it somewhere visible for a while (i.e. next to your track pad on your laptop or on your desk). Soon, you’ll have a great collection of shortcuts you find useful, and will quickly memorize them!
<br />
To use this method with a mouse — not a track pad — put the sticky underneath the mouse to disable the motion sensor. You’ll need a separate sticky to write new commands down on.</p>

<figcaption>I found this method really helpful for learning terminal and <a href="http://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/228600-vim-101-a-beginners-guide-to-vim">vim</a> commands.</figcaption>

<h2 id="a-few-things-ive-learned">A few Things I’ve learned:</h2>

<ul>
  <li><code>⌘ cmd</code> + <code>w</code> closes a tab (general rule)</li>
  <li><code>ctrl + tab</code> navigates my tabs (general rule)</li>
  <li>Use the terminal to make and navigate files</li>
  <li><code>⌘ cmd</code> + <code>⇧ shift + p</code> in Sublime Text (and Atom Editor) and you can probably do anything you need from there</li>
  <li>just <code>⌘ cmd</code> + <code>p</code> in Sublime Text (and Atom Editor) and you can fuzzy search for any file in your project</li>
  <li>Fuzzy search is your friend</li>
  <li>Navigate the Sublime Text (and Atom) sidebar with <code>⌘ cmd</code> + <code>0</code> to focus on the sidebar, and your arrow keys. <code>Enter</code> will open the file. (see plugin below for more fun)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="some-tools-to-help">Some Tools to Help!</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Download <a href="http://alfredapp.com">Alfred</a> to help your workflow out a TON. Alfred is a great tool for navigating not only your applications but also acts as an awesome quick Google search tool. <strong>HIGHLY Recommend</strong> for future keyboard ninjas!</li>
  <li>There’s a great <a href="https://github.com/miguelgraz/FocusFileOnSidebar">Sublime Text plugin</a> that will help you focus on which file you have open. Type <code>⌘ cmd</code> + <code>k</code>, <code>⌘ cmd</code> + <code>f</code> to open the sidebar right to the directory of the current file.</li>
  <li><a href="http://spectacleapp.com/">Spectacle App</a> allows you to move your windows around via keyboard shortcuts. What does that mean? No more clicking and dragging for a split screen! Thanks for the link, Ally.</li>
</ul>

<p>*TIP: when first practicing moving files in terminal, have a text editor with a sidebar open (<code>⌘ cmd</code> + <code>k</code>, <code>⌘ cmd</code> + <code>b</code>) so you can visually see the changes. This is also a great way to illustrate how git works. *</p>
