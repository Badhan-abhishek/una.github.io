I"|<p>So, a lot happened this year.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://instagram.com/p/n3P-q7STls/">graduated</a> from <a href="http://instagram.com/p/ngAFpEyTl0">college</a>, ran a Design Show, explored Iceland, Dublin, London, Croatia, Montenegro, New York, and San Francisco. I built a cli, a chrome extension, made a few <a href="http://sassgifs.com">sass gifs</a>, built a new online <a href="http://unakravets.com">portfolio</a>, migrated my <a href="http://una.github.io">blog</a> to Github and my web server to Digital Ocean.</p>

<blockquote class="right">I learned to trust strangers half way across the world, canceled all my plans for a week, and joined an impromptu road trip through southeastern Europe. </blockquote>

<p>I got a job, bought a car, and drove half way across the country. I moved <strong>three</strong> times this year, and ended up in Austin, Texas. I gave a quick talk at <a href="http://sassconf.com">Sass Conf</a>, spoke at 2 meetups, was on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO17Tpnh3M">Sass Bites</a>, helped organize <a href="http://sassydc.github.io">SassyDC</a> and start the <a href="http://atxsass.com">ATX Sass Meetup</a> (so much Sass!). I participated in hackathons, game jams, open sourced my <a href="http://una.github.io/personal-goals-guide/">personal goals</a>, wrote a bunch of blog posts, got pretty good at working with Gulp, used Meteor.js, Express.js, played with a few different templating libraries, and contributed to open source for the first time. I ran <strong>two</strong> half marathons, learned calligraphy, and learned how to use Vim more effectively.</p>

<h2 id="how-am-i-doing-on-my-personal-goals">How am I Doing On My Personal Goals?</h2>
<p>These are the <a href="https://github.com/una/personal-goals">Overarching Goals</a> I outlined in October.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use Github more often (check)</li>
  <li>Contribute to Open Source (check)</li>
  <li>Blog more (check)</li>
  <li>Increase project efficiency (check)</li>
  <li>Use the command line &amp; keyboard as much as possible (check)</li>
  <li>Up my JS Game (patterns, Angular, Node) (working on it)</li>
  <li>Learn about testing (sort-of)</li>
  <li>Work on fostering designer participation in open source projects (check)</li>
  <li>Make more people smile (hopefully)</li>
  <li>Learn more about WebGL &amp; 3D graphics (nope)</li>
</ul>

<p>So that’s not too bad, but there’s still a lot to work on. And that’s exactly what I’ll be focusing on next year.</p>

<h1 id="2015-just-do-it">2015: Just Do It.</h1>

<p>Just do it. Get up and go. Fuck it, ship it. That’s my plan. <a class="left twitter-share">Don’t think, just do.</a> I’ve got a lot of ideas and a lot of interests. Here are a few coming down the pipeline, by which I am going to clean up and restructure my public personal goals by (because they got a little messy) after New Years day.</p>

<h2 id="professional">Professional</h2>

<p>Professionally, I want to get better at harnessing the power of JavaScript (sounds so epic, right?). This includes learning <strong>node.js</strong> and understanding <strong>core concepts</strong> better, as well as practicing more often with <strong>MV</strong>* Frameworks and <strong>testing</strong>. I don’t use these much at work, but I want to be as fluent in JavaScript (not just jQuery) as I am in Sass.</p>

<p>I also want to continue speaking and getting involved in community. This includes the <strong>open source design</strong> community, being a <strong>Sassvocate</strong>, making people care about <strong>performance</strong>, and being a better advocate of <strong>STEM for girls</strong> (specifically in middle school, but really of all ages). I want to <strong>speak at conferences</strong> and continue to run <strong>ATXSass</strong> with a smile. This year I’ll be more organized :)</p>

<h3 id="projects-in-the-pipeline">Projects in the Pipeline</h3>

<p>I’m getting an <strong>arduino</strong> for the holidays (New Years is my family’s holiday) and can’t wait to get started with it. I have a few ideas already. I am also going to reinstate one of my older projects with a new name, <strong>Heiroglyph</strong> and try to be as open source about the design and development of that as much as possible. I’m doing some free development and design work for a non-profit called <strong>Urban Patchwork</strong> that I met at a hackathon.</p>

<p>As of last week, I was sort-of Twitter challenged to start a podcast. And because of my love for <a href="http://localhost:3000/comprehension/">auditory learning</a>, and since I don’t see that many out there, I’m going to start <strong>Caret Cast</strong> early next year. I want to create a <strong>typeface</strong> and learn about <strong>web scraping</strong> to improve the Sass Docs CLI I wrote. I’ll continue <strong>blogging</strong> and playing around with libraries and frameworks as I learn about them.</p>

<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>

<p>All of my personal goals center around health and connectivity. I want to <strong>get fit</strong> again. A way that has worked for me before is to simply start counting my calories, no matter what, for every meal, every day. And since I’m a nerd, to make it more fun, I want to do something with this data. I haven’t decided what that will be yet, but I’m trying to get access to the MyFitnessPal API to be able to extract my realtime info. I want to run another <strong>half marathon</strong>, so I’d better start running again too :P Oh and I’m going to sign up for a <strong>dance</strong> class because I really miss dancing and it makes me happy.</p>

<p>I want to be better at <strong>staying in touch</strong> with some of the incredible people I’ve met over the past few years. I want to pay better attention to their lives and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3yyF31jbKo">surprise</a> them with random gifts and letters because everyone deserves that.</p>

<p>I also plan on traveling to Asia. I might go to <strong>China</strong> in February, but its pretty last minute, so I’m more looking to going to <strong>Thailand</strong> in April. We’ll see what happens when I get there, but I’ll definitely be traveling. A weekend trip to <strong>Colorado</strong> or a roadtrip to <strong>Marfa</strong> could be fun, too.</p>

<p>So that’s what my year is looking like right now. But I know that plans change, and I’m going to embrace whatever comes my way in 2015 :) See y’all on the flip side!</p>
