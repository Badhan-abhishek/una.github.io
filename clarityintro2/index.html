  <h1>Clarity Conf Intro Song (Day 2)</h1>
  <h2>Conference in California</h2>

  <p>
    On a bright Wednesday morning, made it back for day two,<br>
    Warm smell of some coffee, is what got me through,<br>
     I’m still a little hazy, but I’m excited for talks,<br>
    Speakers here from around the states, Where can I get some Slack socks? (no, really)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are talks on performance, and whatever comes next,<br> 
    after you’ve built a designs system, and hope its a success,<br> 
    So we can stand in the courtyard, toast when our work is recieved,<br> 
    Some developers don't need docs, but those developers can leave.
  </p> 
  
  <p class="chorus">
    Welcome to a conference in California,<br>
    Such a lovely place, Such a lovely stage,<br>
    Plenty to learn at this conference in California,<br>
    Now day two begins, Hope I can take it all in.<br>
  </p>
