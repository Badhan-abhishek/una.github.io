When designers and developers get involved in conversations from the start, it produces better outcomes. But how can we get designers to get involved and participate more in the open source community from the start? In order to figure out how to fix it, we need to take a look at the barriers for designers (why they don't participate in open source), and how we can work together to to influence change.

## Defining "Open Source Design"
For me, I see 3 distinct ways that the term “Open Source Design" can be interpreted:

1. **"Designing in the Open"**: This means showing design progress in the open, or "designing out loud." A lot of designers operate in a very different way: hiding unfinished and rough sketches due to fear of premature critisism: the "but it's not ready yet" mentality. Websites like [Design Open](http://designopen.org) and [Pixelapse](https://www.pixelapse.com/open) are working to encourage this open design for collaboration and better communitcation.
2. **Designing for public consumption**: Open sourcing your designs (i.e. icon sets, themes, layouts, stock photography, vector graphics, etc.) for others to use in their own work. This is all about making resources free for others. The [League of Moveable Type](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/), for instance provides some beautiful free fonts. [Open Designs](http://www.opendesigns.org/) is another example.
3. **Designing for the Open Source Community** (like on Github). This definition is about designers working in conjunction with developers to participate in their open source projects. When the two work together, the results are [beautiful](http://beautifulopen.com/) and make the open source projects more usable (therefore more likely to be adapted, grown, expanded &mdash; and the cycle goes on and on).

The third definition *(Designing for the Open Source Community)* is what I'd like to focus on.

Defining the problem is the first step in solving it.

### The "Fuck You, Pay Me" Mentality

If you haven't [seen it yet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVkLVRt6c1U), Mike Montiero gave one of the most famous Creative Mornings talks ever in 2011 where he encouraged creatives to not take abuse and payment refusal from their clients. Because of the ignorant opinion that design is superfluous and subjective, designers need to defend their value to clients way more often than they should. Designers therefore have a knee-jerk reaction when asked to do "free work." 

** Percieved value increases dramatically

- BRAND OVER BRAIN: http://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/308752278/brand-over-brain

This is an issue that developers rarely face. Let's remind ourselves that an industry who uses their free time to do free work is in a pretty lucky position. 
<mark>Rewrite this stuff</mark>

In most cases with clients, it normally isn't a question for developers whether or not they will get paid for what they do, but designers are constantly defending their value to clients. This is something taught as empowering in college.

### The Intimidation Barrier

Designers and developers are often going about solving the same goals, but with different tool sets. And the tools that developers use for open source can be really intimidating at first, especially when you don't know what you're doing. I know a lot of designers who would love to help but are afraid of "breaking something" in the process. And right now, developers and designers don't really have a "best way of communicating" that is natural to each others distinct workflow. I wrote more extensively about this topic for [Design Open](http://designopen.org/barriers-for-designers).

### The Ownership Problem

This is not an issue of greed or wanting credit for work, but it's a problem with feeling like your work doesn't really belong to you. That sounds strange, but let me explain. 

Focusing on small design components is intimidating and blocking without the full story. How can a designer make the best choices for people when they might not have the full story? How can we delineate tasks when multiple designers and developers are working together on a problem?

Developers often work on open source projects that they use in their daily workflow, finding bugs naturally and improving them. Designers don't have this ability, because they (generally) don't have the technical capabilities to go into a piece of software they use and provide a solution for their bugs. 

### The Threat of "Design By Committee"

Ah, the hovering art director.

- [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com) is an example of trying this approach: it was originally supposed to be a platform for works-in-progress to get feedback and critique. Now, Dribbble has become a showcase for best work, a miniature portfolio platform.

[Pixelapse](https://www.pixelapse.com/explore) is a brand new ____. I think things like this will fail in the open community sense because of the ownership problem and design by committee.

## Talking with Designers

Codepen as a great example of mixing design and dev types
- desigenrs at hackathons
  - language is important : the term hackathon scares designers away
- ive been talking to designers who are really interested [link to that site]

## Conclusions for now

And watch this really awesome [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djf8sLjtbzU) on Open Source Design.


- Dribbble like place for experimentation
  --> making it okay to experiment
- don't call it open source? <-- language is huge
- styleguides can be a key link between designers and developers
    -> modular/componment-based design
    -> educating on that approach
- a manigest of what can be and nees design on the project page in conributing.md or to-do file
- Open source projects that we work on — someone can create a backlog of design issues i.e. nice typography for page
- a space where devs can find you
- tagging system
- weekly chat aboutit <-- lets keep talking about it

--> crits: building up rather than tearing down

`need design type:issue state:open is:public`

Search that on GitHub if you want (Will show open public issues stating design is needed)

`label:design state:open is:public`
