When designers and developers get involved in conversatinos from the start, it produced better outcomes. At SassConf this year, there was a lot of talk about why designers don't contribute to open source, and how we can start to influence change.

## So, what IS "Open Source Design"
For me, I see 3 main ways that “Open Source Design" can we defined:

1. "Designing in the Open" --> showing your progress as you go. Fro, ideation to sketching and not hiding anything or saying "but it's not ready yet!"
2. Open sourcing your designs for others to use (icon sets, themes, layouts, stock photography, vector graphics, etc.) http://www.oswd.org/
3. Design as part of the open source community (like here on Github). Designers working with developers from the start.

Conversation on Designers in Open Source

how to give designer more ownership over what they’re working on
start working on it early on
codepen <— mix of dev and design types
a place where they can experiment
dribbble is a space for collecting work as you’re working on it (githibbble)
“you’re here to experiment”
Github for Designers
your page where people can start to see what you’re up to
could work with the new PS diffs
a space where devs can find you
Github is a space for developers
PS diffs just added
devs do open source bc they normally get paid to do work — knee jerk reaction when designers are asked to do “free work”
thats WHY designers don’t do open source
Designers at hackathons
the term “hackathon” turns off designers
Startup weekends 

Don’t call it “open source” <— language is huge
nature of open source is that micro commits can add up but designers look at the big picture
looking at small pieces is intimidating too b/c you don’t have the context
there are open source projects that want design work and have open issues
theres a tag for it ex. scikit-learn
beautiful open source projects site  http://beautifulopen.com/
designers arent exploring and browsing github
we focus on the projects that we work on
Open source projects that we work on — someone can create a backlog of design issues i.e. nice typography for page
A manifest of what can be designed and needs to be
modular or component based design
style guides can be key
debs working together to make style guides
