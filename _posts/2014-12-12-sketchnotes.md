__LAST WEEK?!__ I wrote a post about comprehension and learning, and referenced some data, including this really great [TED Talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/sunni_brown#t-213976) on how studies show that doodling helps with creative thinking and comprehension. As an extension of that, let's talk about sketchnotes. Sketchnotes are essentially a creative form of note-taking, and can take a few different forms. I interviewed some pretty rad ladies about their sketch-noting techniques.

## Jess Eldredge

## Carolyn Sewell on Process

Carolyn Sewell, an incredible typgraphy and ____ has a really unique approach to sketchnoting. She outlines her process in 3 steps:

### Step 1: Skeletal

I take skeletal notes during the actual talk, listening for quotable phrases, writing them as quickly as possible, and making sure to leave plenty of wiggle room.

### Step 2: Bulking

Once home, and usually during an NCIS marathon, I start bulking up the layout...adding structure to the words and symbols.

### Step 3: Filling

 Then I fill in everything (I go through a lot of ink at this point), scan it in and clean up.
