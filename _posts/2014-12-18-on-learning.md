subtitle: I've been doing a lot of research and experimentation lately about how people learn. This post might give you some ideas to improve your own comprehension and think about your own learning style.

We often see blog posts about optimizing our images or HTML, or even our teams work flow. But what about optimizing our comprehension? In an ever-changing industry where tools, ideas, and opinions grow parabolically, how can we keep up? As somebody who is both stubbornly ambitious and has a really terrible memory, This is a topic very close to my heart.

Front end developers are often bombarded with so many tasks, options, and stimuli, that we end up being overwhelmed by choices, often causing a complete paralysis and block to getting anything done at all. This is called **option paralysis** or **analysis paralysis** (that's a real thing). And it doesn't help that we work on the internet, where opening a new tab is like walking into a new room, causing us to forget what we were just focused on doing.

## The Doorway Effect

Tammy Everts wrote a really good [blog post](http://www.webperformancetoday.com/2012/03/21/neuroscience-page-speed-web-performance/) about this exact phenomenon &mdash; **"The doorway effect"** &mdash; where she relates neuroscience to the need for quick and efficient website performance. Sensory memory, which is responsible for persistence of vision, works in 100ms bursts. Once this time is up, we simply move on to the next sensory input to take up that space. Google's Urz Holzle, in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MStKwEff_kY) talk at Velocity 2010, describes how their goal is to make web pages seamless &mdash; like they are pages in a book. He says, *"we're really aiming, something very, very, high here, at something like 100ms."* Ironic? Maybe not.

## How We Learn

While there is some disagreement on whether people learn better when tailoring their experience to a particular "learning style" (AKA the are-learning-styles-even-real debate), it is universally agreed upon that various stimuli do influence our ability to recall information.

## Learning Styles

--> infographic?

## Doodling

--> TED Talk about doodling
--> visuals of some of my doodles
--> repetative motion illustration allows me to listen while doing a mundane task
  --> mind works best (i.e. coding) when not at 100% bc then its too tired to get distracted

## Listen to Your Blog Posts

Something I started doing lately is **listening** to blog posts instead of just reading them. If I really want to absorb the content, I will do both. Listening allows me to focus only mildly on the content, as to absorb it better.

--> great while painting or doodling (mundane task)
--> multiple stimuli == better comprehension

--> app in iPad
--> Chrome extension

## Actively Avoid Your Other Tasks

Focusing is something that I often have trouble with. I have so many ideas, so many thoughts, so many things I want to do *right now!* So yes, I understand how advising someone to "focus on one task" literally means nothing. However, one of my coworkers the other day told me the same thing, but from a different perspective. She said:

<a class="quote twitter-share">Pick one thing and try not to think about any of the other things you're not doing.</a>

Well, of course! That makes sense. Instead of actively trying to focus on one task, actively avoid doing other tasks. If you are making a concious decision that it is in your best interest to not do those other things for now, it alleviates the anxiety of not doing them. There are also a lot of tools I use to help with distractions while working (a different, but related topic).

## Avoiding Distractions

#### Self Control

The [Self Control App](http://selfcontrolapp.com/) allows you to self-elect to block content on distracting websites (i.e. Facebook) for a set period of time. The app prevents your computer from accessing any of the sites on your "block list," reminding you to get back to focusing on the task and preventing you from falling into a black hole of distraction.

#### Music You Already Know

When I try to get work done, I listen to music that's familiar to me. If I put on new music (i.e. someone else's playlist), and hear something I like, I'll end up researching lyrics, and adding it to my own playlists, searching other songs by that artist, etc. You get the point. Play music that won't be an unintended distraction.

### Ordered Lists

******* TAKE PHOTO OF ONE OF MY MOLESKINES AROUND FINALS *******

While long, scattered lists may cause a lot of the tension I relayed in the beginning of the post, an ordered list can alleviate it. This was something I did a lot around finals time in college. I would write out higher-order lists of tasks (broken down into actionable steps) and then ordered those. Don't allow yourself to move on to task 2 before completing task 1.

## Reflecting

--> Personal goals
--> did this help?
--> did this help others?
