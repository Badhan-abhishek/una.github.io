subtitle: I've been doing a lot of research and experimentation lately about how people learn. This post might give you some ideas to improve your own comprehension and think about your own learning style.

We often see blog posts about optimizing our images or HTML, or even our teams work flow. But what about optimizing our comprehension? In an ever-changing industry where tools, ideas, and opinions grow parabolically, how can we keep up? This is a topic very close to my heart as somebody who is both stubbornly ambitious and also has a really terrible memory.

Front end developers are often bombarded with so many tasks, options, and stimuli, that we end up being overwhelmed by choices, often causing a complete paralysis and block to getting anything done at all. This is called **option paralysis** or **analysis paralysis** (that's a real thing). And it doesn't help that we work on the internet, where opening a new tab is like walking into a new room, causing us to forget what we were just focused on doing, and starting on a new stimuli instead.

## The Doorway Effect

Tammy Everts wrote a really good [blog post](http://www.webperformancetoday.com/2012/03/21/neuroscience-page-speed-web-performance/) about this phenomenon &mdash; **"The Doorway Effect"** &mdash; where she relates neuroscience to the need for quick and efficient website performance. In short, the Doorway Effect explains why we can go searching for something in one room, walk into another room to look for it, and forget what we were looking for in the first place. This is due to our [sensory memory](http://www.appsychology.com/Book/Cognition/Memory/memoryintro.htm), which works surprisingly similarly to a computer's memory bank.

**Sensory memory**, which is responsible for persistence of vision, works in 100ms bursts. Once this time is up, we simply move on to the next sensory input to take up that space. Google's Urz Holzle, in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MStKwEff_kY) talk at Velocity 2010, describes how their goal is to make web pages seamless &mdash; like they are pages in a book. He says, *"we're really aiming, something very, very, high here, at something like 100ms."* Ironic? Maybe. Maybe not.

What got me really interested recently in how we learn is this brilliant [TED Talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/sunni_brown?language=en) by Sunni Brown about how doodling during meetings is actually really good for you. It was shared with me by Jodi Cutler, who responded to an Instagram doodle I posted after a meeting at work (at first, before I clicked the link, I thought, shit, I must be in trouble). The TED Talk outlines how ignorantly negative perceptions of doodling are inconsistent with statistics based on education research. So we'll get back to doodling in a second. Let's talk about how we learn first.

## Learning Modalities

While there is some [disagreement](http://elearninginfographics.com/the-myth-of-learning-styles-infographic/) on whether people learn better when tailoring their experience to a particular "learning style" (AKA the are-learning-styles-even-real debate), it is universally agreed upon that various stimuli do influence our ability to recall information. These stimuli come in four "modalities:" **visual, auditory, read/write, and kinesthetic.**

![](../images/posts/learning-types.svg)

According to Sunni Brown's research, In order to really comprehend information and do something with it, **we must engage either two of those modalities, or any one of them paired with an emotional response**. This is because memory is stored in terms of [meaning](http://www.readingrockets.org/article/do-visual-auditory-and-kinesthetic-learners-need-visual-auditory-and-kinesthetic-instruction), and activating multiple senses during any experience makes it more meaningful and memorable.

## Doodling

So back to doodling. Doodling gets a bad reputation as something people do when they're uninterested or unfocused, but that is far from true! According to recent neuroscience [studies](http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-power-of-the-doodle-improve-your-focus-and-memory-1406675744), **people who doodle were more likely to retain information than those who did not** (about 29% more to be exact). In addition to an increased retention, doodlers have proven to be more creative and spark more ideas. <blockquote class="left">Drawing an image helps stimulate new images in your brain that spark ideas.</blockquote> Brown preaches that *"doodling should be leveraged in ... situations where information density is very high."*

This made me feel a lot better about my doodling, which has covered the sides of my school notes and has recently found itself creeping onto post its and sketchbooks. It can be awkward, especially around new teams, where people may think you're ignoring them or not listening. Education is key here. To further avoid distraction, I personally find that the best method for me is to doodle repetitive, geometric shapes. it keeps my body moving and my mind in a neutral state.

<a class="quote twitter-share">"Doodling helps you concentrate and grasp new concepts because it keeps the brain at an ideal state of arousal"</a>

This idea relates to a lot of the reasons why [Developers Work At Night](http://swizec.com/blog/why-programmers-work-at-night/swizec/3198), specifically about the **"sleepy brain"**. When we're at 100% brain power, and buzzing, we're thinking about too many other things to concentrate on a single task. [Swizec Teller's](http://nightowlsbook.com/) theory of the "sleepy brain", says that we work best at night because "there isn't enough left-over brainpower to afford losing concentration."

## Listening

Something I just started doing lately (unlike doodling) is **listening** to blog posts instead of reading them. This stemmed out of my intense desire to multi-task as much as possible, and I think its been working pretty well. If I really want to focus on the content, I will do both (read and listen to the same text). That way, if I get distracted and end up on another web page, there is still the **auditory stimuli that keeps my sensory memory flowing** (thus avoiding the "doorway effect"), reminding me of my previous task (listening to the article)

<a class="quote twitter-share right">I liked listening to my blog posts so much, that I started turning ebooks into audiobooks</a>

Listening also allows that mild, ideal temperament for information comprehension. One night, while relaxing and crafting holiday cards, I found myself going through 7 or 8 blog posts. The way the I do this is via a Chrome extension called
--> great while painting or doodling (mundane task)
--> multiple stimuli == better comprehension

--> app in iPad
--> Chrome extension

I can't write while I listen to talks and blog posts. I can't

## Actively Avoid Your Other Tasks

Focusing is something that I often have trouble with. I have so many ideas, so many thoughts, so many things I want to do *right now!* So yes, I understand how advising someone to "focus on one task" literally means nothing. However, one of my coworkers the other day told me the same thing, but from a different perspective. She said:

<a class="quote twitter-share">Pick one thing and try not to think about any of the other things you're not doing.</a>

Well, of course! That makes sense. Instead of actively trying to focus on one task, actively avoid doing other tasks. If you are making a concious decision that it is in your best interest to not do those other things for now, it alleviates the anxiety of not doing them.

## Avoiding Distractions

Rolling back to that first statement on our short term memory, avoiding distractions (or avoiding "The doorway effect"), will help you in completing whatever learning you've begun. There are a lot of tools I use to help with distractions while working (a different, but related topic).

### Self Control

The [Self Control App](http://selfcontrolapp.com/) allows you to self-elect to block content on distracting websites (i.e. Facebook) for a set period of time. The app prevents your computer from accessing any of the sites on your "block list," reminding you to get back to focusing on the task and preventing you from falling into a black hole of distraction.

### Music You Already Know

When I try to get work done, I listen to music that's familiar to me. If I put on new music (i.e. someone else's playlist), and hear something I like, I'll end up researching lyrics, and adding it to my own playlists, searching other songs by that artist, etc. You get the point. Play music that won't be an unintended distraction.

### Ordered Lists

******* TAKE PHOTO OF ONE OF MY MOLESKINES AROUND FINALS *******

While long, scattered lists may cause a lot of the tension I relayed in the beginning of the post, an ordered list can alleviate it. This was something I did a lot around finals time in college. I would write out higher-order lists of tasks (broken down into actionable steps) and then ordered those. Don't allow yourself to move on to task 2 before completing task 1.

## Reflecting

--> Personal goals
--> did this help?
--> did this help others?

I do all of this because I know its a lot harder for me to learn than it is for others. Like I said, that + this ridiculous ambition == weekends spent writing blog posts.
