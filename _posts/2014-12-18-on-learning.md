subtitle: I've been doing a lot of research and experimentation lately about how I learn. This post might give you some ideas to improve your own comprehension and think about your own learning style.

## Learning Styles

--> infographic?

## Doodling

--> TED Talk about doodling
--> visuals of some of my doodles
--> repetative motion illustration allows me to listen while doing a mundane task
  --> mind works best (i.e. coding) when not at 100% bc then its too tired to get distracted

## Listen to Your Blog Posts

Something I started doing lately is **listening** to blog posts instead of just reading them. If I really want to absorb the content, I will do both. Listening allows me to focus only mildly on the content, as to absorb it better.

--> great while painting or doodling (mundane task)
--> multiple stimuli == better comprehension

--> app in iPad
--> Chrome extension

## Reflecting

--> Personal goals
--> did this help?
--> did this help others?
