Code like this sort of makes me want to cry:

```
.mui-text-full-black          { color: $full-black; }
.mui-text-dark-black          { color: $dark-black; }
.mui-text-light-black         { color: $light-black; }
.mui-text-min-black           { color: $min-black; }
.mui-text-full-white          { color: $full-white; }
.mui-text-dark-white          { color: $dark-white; }
.mui-text-light-white         { color: $light-white; }
```

So why am I seeing this? Well, three reasons:

1. I like Google's [Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html)
2. I like Sass, and
3. I like refactoring :)

So recently I jumped on to work on an open source [material-ui](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui) Sass port. It looked great on the [outside](http://material-ui.com/#/) but once I got into the code... oh my.

That's okay. I like a challenge, and I've already learned some things, like **unquote!**

## Unquote() my strings!

It works like it sounds. I'm writing this post because I had never heard of it before, and I thought it was a pretty cool [function](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/nex3/sass/Sass/Script/Functions:unquote). Using `unquote()` in sass will simply remove quotation marks.

## An Example

So, like I said, I was trying to match the above code, but write it cleaner. This was my solution:

```
$mui-text-color-vars: full-black, dark-black, light-black, min-black, full-white, dark-white, light-white;

@mixin mui-text($color-name) {
  .mui-text-#{$color-name} {
    color: unquote('$' + '#{$color-name}');
  }
}

@each $color in $mui-text-color-vars {
  @include mui-text($color);
};
```

What I kept trying to do was match the **color name** in the class name (NOT condoning this, by the way, just trying to start helping to clean up this code base) and I had a lot of issues when trying to append the `$` to the class name. A few solutions I tried which gave me results I didn't like:

<pre class="scss"><code>color: "'$' + '#{$color-name}'"
</code></pre>
<pre class="css"><code>color: "'$' + 'dark-black'"
</code></pre>

- `color: '$' + '#{$color-name}';` --> `color: "$dark-black";`
