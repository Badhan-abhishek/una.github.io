First of all, this post contains no technical information. If you're looking for code, or productivity/workflow tips, come back next year. This is merely a reflection on my year. And holy crap, a lot has happened.

I've been thinking about retrospection a lot over the past few weeks. And every time I start to jumble some words together, they seem to get lost in a tangle of "holy crap, I can't believe how much has changed." I'm not talking technically &mdash; just talking about my life in general. I graduated college ... ... ....

And now here I am in Austin. And I'm single, and I feel like I'm losing my grasp on reality every day.

I'm realizing that I'll never be okay with being just okay. I really, really, really want to build things, and do things, and have this insane drive to create. It's wonderful sometimes, a bit crazy other times, and it causes me to go to sleep not when I'm tired, but when my computer battery dies.

I'm going to embrace the crazy. Sure, some days it makes me overwhelmed and anxious and wanting to just give up. But, when am I ever going to be single, independent, without responsiblity again? I'll drive myself mad but I'm really hoping for something good in 2015. I have really high hopes for next year.

## Setting Priorities

For the ambitious young girl, setting priorities and figuring out where to begin is difficult. I have so many ideas! Sometimes I get so overwhelmed I end up getting nowhere

## Resolutions

### Work out Every Day

This sounds insane. But seriously, I realize that working out is the only way to keep me happy and balanced. I've learned that I learn better when moving.

### Prioritize. Seriously. Stop it.
