The web is the most accessible, most widespread, and therby most powerful communication tool we have as a sociaty. And to humans, communication is at the root of our existence. __ sentance about humans, psychology, and society___. Our tribe has become global, our ideas have merged, and the web has allowed for some incredible collaborations accross borders the have moved us all forward.

With the emergence of this communication network, came the emergence of the data revolution, and web advertising, and ____. You can pretty much learn anything or get anything you can imagine online today (for better or for worse). Politics aside, the technologies with which we can access the web are evolving.

From Google's [physical web project](#) to the emergence of more [affordable](#) virtual reality and augmented reality systems, it's time to take a serious look at how the web is changing, and the exciting possibilites for its application outside of screens. And this really means rethinking responsive design because **the future of the web exists beyond screens.**

## Web VR

It's an exciting time to work on the web because the platforms on which we can communicate are growing exponentially. It's still early, but WebVR, at least to me, has a really exciting future. Despite [Facebook's recent attempts](#) I'm not entirely sold that virtual reality will be "the future" per se, but it can change how we recieve information and communicate with people around the world. VR (virtual reality) is an incredible tool for story telling, and the application of VR to journalism is particularly powerful, as it really emerses the viewer an environment that really helps them to absorb a story.

WebVR can create immersive experiences too, and maybe one day, bring the ease of communication that a website provides into a 3D context. This can be great for understanding ambiance of a restaurant, or hotel, or even a design agency's aesthetic. An entirely new medium in which to present information.

However, the real future for the web I forsee is one when we finally have affordable AR (augmented reality) and can simultaneously interact with the web and the world around us. This means we can look up information while continuing to go about our day, having a seamless experience which the web initiated in 1980 ****CHECK DATE*****.

While there's nothing that allows us to experiment with this on the web just yet, experimenting with WebVR is an exciting precursor. [A Frame](#) by Mozilla is probably the closest thing to what I imagine a future 3D framework will be for us to experiment with now.

The more I think about virtual and augmented web, the more excited I get about the possibilities.

## The Physical Web

Another thing I'm really excited about is the core idea behind Google's physical web project.

The premise of the project, led by [_____](#), is simple: using a URL bar as the only means of communication with the vast resources of the web is outdated. It brings the web to the physical world via beacons -- these are, in their current state, little devices that can be attached to anything: movie posters, restaurants, ____, which send out signals inviting you to the web.

Instead of the URL bar as the initiator of an online experience, you have a physical object initating the exchange in the real world. Getting a ping to open a URL feels much more natural than the added step of opening a browser and typing one in to reach the same outcome.

## Rethinking Responsive

What does this all mean for responsive design? It means that we need to consider the user's experience in terms of their surroundings. How can we use new browser technology to leverage that? We now have a plethora of options. Just to name 3:

- **Geolocation** (which opens up so many possibilities alone, like getting information on weather, news, events, etc.)
- **Battery-Level Detection** (meaning the developer can determine when they send more decorative content like animations or refrain if its a drain on scarce system resources)
- **Ambient Light Queries** (allow the browser to detect how dark or light the surroundings of the user are, enabling style adjustment acordingly)

All of these Web APIs (most of which require [HTTPS](#link-to-site-which-had-the-warning)) can be combined to give the user a truly *responsive* experience. Something that isn't just responsive to the screen size of the device being used, but is **responsive to the user in their current context.**

<blockquote class="right" style="padding-bottom:.7em"><a class="twitter-share">The future of responsive design relates to a user's current context, not the size of their devices</a></blockquote>

I first started thinking of responsive in this way while working at a startup called [nvite](http://nvite.com). The idea was to build a product responsive to an event in terms of both physical location to and time until the event. *That* was nvite's definition of a responsive experience. And it really has stuck with me because simply put, it's the future of responsive experiences. And it's exactly kind of thinking, combined with the emerging platforms we're uncovering for the web, that we need to nourish, and to consider when building products. We need to recognize that screens are ephemeral, and that <a class="twitter-share">making something responsive will no longer be about screen sizes. It'll be about experiences.</a>
