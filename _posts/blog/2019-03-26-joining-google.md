Hello friends, I have an exciting announcement! I've accepted a position at Google as a Developer Advocate on the [Material Design Web](https://material.io/develop/web/) team! I'll be doing what I've always loved doing: working in the intersection of design and development, experimenting with web technology, and sharing what I'm learning and building along the way!

This role involves so many things I love/have worked on over the past few years of my career: systems design, scaling product UI, accessibility, UX and interaction design, open source, etc. **And** it involves a lot of what I've been spending my personal time doing: writing blog posts about the things I was learning/working with, organizing/attending community events, building open source projects, writing talks, recording podcasts, etc. 

I love hearing people get excited or inspired by something I've put out there, and build something of their own. I love traveling and meeting devs all around the world and nerding out and sharing ideas. Some of the best times I've ever had have been at conferences, and they've taken me to *6 of the 7 continents* (just missing Antarctica). It's exhausting at times, but I absolutely love it, and I would keep doing it all regardless. Except NOW... **it's going to be a part of my actual DAY JOB**. Can you believe that?! What am I going to do on my weekends?

I'm really looking forward to working with the team of [Material Design Advocates](https://medium.com/@crafty/google-%EF%B8%8F-%EF%B8%8Fdesigners-c12b70627b2e), Engineers, and Web Developer Advocates to help make one of the world's most well-known design systems even better. And I'd love to hear from you â€” if there's anything you think would help you build with Material, or what you wish a design system could do for you, let me know! I'm all ears, and I'm incredibly excited to dive in.

I'll have even more time in my life now for content creation! SQUEEE!</small>
