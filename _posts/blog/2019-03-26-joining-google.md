Hello friends, I have an exciting announcement! I've accepted a position at Google as a Developer Advocate on the [Material Design Web](https://material.io/develop/web/) team! I'll be doing what I've always loved doing: working in the intersection of design and development, experimenting with web technology, and sharing what I'm learning and building along the way!

I wasn't particularly *searching* for another job when this opportunity came my way (my role at [Bustle](https://bustle.company) is super creative, and I've seen the company more than double in size since I started there), but this role was just too perfect not to pursue. It involves all the things I love and have worked on over the past few years of my career: systems design, community work, accessibility, creative web design, user experience, interaction design, educating other devs, building demos, creating easy-to-digest content, scaling products, I COULD GO ON. It's such a creative role in its own right and the team seems AMAZING already (hi y'all)!

For the past 5 years, I've written all of my talks, organized events, written blog posts, made videos, podcasts, and demos during my free time because I really love this stuff. But NOW.. it's going to be a part of my actual DAY JOB. Can you believe that?! What am I going to do on my weekends?

Some of the best times I've ever had have been at conferences. They've taken me to 6 continents (just missing Antarctica!) and allowed for me to meet so many amazing humans who I value so much and am constantly inspired by! I am so grateful for all of these opportunities and unbelievably excited that more will be a part of my DAY JOB.

I'm really looking forward to working with the team of [Material Design Advocates](https://medium.com/@crafty/google-%EF%B8%8F-%EF%B8%8Fdesigners-c12b70627b2e) (they seem super super cool!), Engineers, and Web Developer Advocates to help make one of the world's most well-known design systems even better.

I have a ton of ideas and I'm so excited to get started! And I'd love to hear from you â€” if there's anything you think would help you build with Material, or what you wish a design system could do for you, let me know! I'm all ears, and I'm unbelivably excited to dive into it.

Toolsday will go on!
