I really love to &mdash; 1 &mdash; come up with clever hacks and &mdash; 2 &mdash; blow people's minds with CSS. Many often don't realize how powerful it is (especially when combined with the preprocessing prowess of Sass). Well, this post is about to combine those two things. It's not practical and it's not something your next client will ask for. But, it is a fun little showcase/trick and you'll likely learn something new about CSS.

## Counter-Increment

`counter-increment` is a relatively obscure CSS property originally intended for use for numbering outlines. [Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/css_reference/counter-increment/) has a *great* reference for this, and a number of other CSS properties.

### Counter-Reset

In order to use `counter-increment`, we must first instantiate a counter on a section with `counter-reset`. The value for both `counter-increment` and `counter-reset` should match, but can be anything. For example:

```
section {
  counter-reset: unicornz;
}

section h1 {
  counter-increment: unicornz;
}
```

In the above code, each `<h1>` element inside of the section will be counted up by the value of **1**.

### Custom Counters

- can set counter-increment custom values

## Counting with Counter-Increment

- checkboxes

## Checking Checkboxes

- binary thing
- checking a series of not and checked's
