CSS grid has been exploding in popularity on the web as its becoming increasingly implemented in browsers ([upvote here for Edge](https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/257854-microsoft-edge-developer/suggestions/6514853-update-css-grid)). [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/developer/css-grid/) just came out with a pretty sweet Grid layout developer tools view, and I imagine Chrome will soon, too.

Current support is as follows:

<div class="iframe-frame" style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 310px; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe style="position: absolute; top: -315px; width: 100%; height: 600px;" src="http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid"></iframe>
</div>

Now, there are a lot of awesome tutorials and learning resources out there (linked at the bottom of this post), so this post isn't going to be a how-to guide, but instead about the "why." There are a few things I'm really loving about CSS grid, and hopefully they'll convince you to give it a spin! :)

## Templates

Grid has a few ways to lay out templates, including a new unit called th *fr*, or *fractional*, ala *a fractional part of the space*. My favorite template method, however is `grid-template-areas`! This allows you to create *named* areas that correspond to `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows`. You can literally write out a map!

Take this example:

<p data-height="425" data-theme-id="5255" data-slug-hash="BWPbzV" data-default-tab="result" data-user="una" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="CSS Grid + Flexbox Layout Demo with Fallback" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/una/pen/BWPbzV/">CSS Grid + Flexbox Layout Demo with Fallback</a> by Una Kravets (<a href="http://codepen.io/una">@una</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

<br/>

<div class="half--left">
The code for the grid looks like:

<pre><code class="css">body {
  /* columns based at half
     the viewport width */
  grid-template-columns: 50vw;
  /* header + sections = set height
     but footer is auto-sized */
  grid-template-rows: 10vh 40vh 40vh auto;
  /* grid template areas here! */
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header"
    "top-left top-right"
    "bottom-left bottom-right"
    "footer footer";
}</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="half--right">
and translates into:
<img src="../images/posts/css-grid/template-areas.jpg" alt="template areas as a grid" style="margin-top:0">
</div>


Grid is great bc it makes more semantic sense for layouts

## Gutter the Way We Want it

This. THIS! CSS Grid implements `grid-gap` which creates a gutter *between your elements*. Let me demonstrate why you want this:

- how margin is annoying
- hacky or manual to do it otherwise (can do with flexbox positioning but its not quiet there)
- similar to column-gap but thats for text only
