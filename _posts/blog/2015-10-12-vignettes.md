This is part of a series of posts breaking down visual effects using CSS filters and blend modes. Read [Part 1: The Vintage Washout Effect](/vintage-washout) and [Part 2: 3d Glasses](/3d-effect) for some background on blend modes. In this post we'll explore one of the most popular photo filters: the vignette. A vignette fades an image around the corners to draw attention to the center. There are a few ways to get this effect with CSS.

## Way 1: Inverted Box Shadow

## Way 2: CSS Gradients
