If You Know Sass, You know ES2015!...well not exactly, but there **are** a surprising number of similarities! While learning about the [latest ECMAScript specification](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/), ES2015 (formerly known as ES6), I came upon a few features that I immediately recognized from Sass. And I kept seeing more and more similarities pop up. A lot of the concepts of Sass development transfer over quiet nicely, so if you know some Sass, you're probably a lot better off than you may think when it comes to diving into modern JavaScript, and visa versa.

## Sass Lang and ES2015

The [Sass language](http://sass-lang.com) was written very intentionally. It was originally released in 2006, and being written in Ruby, also imitated the Ruby syntax and some of its language decisions. Among other features, semicolons and curly braces to make Sass feel more like (and be compatible with) CSS3 emerged in [version 3.0.0](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_CHANGELOG.html#scss_sassy_css). That change, plus the extensible core Sass functionality (SassScript), made it a robust programming language newly compatible with CSS. Styling became *much* more powerful to a much wider audience of designers and developers.

There's a lot of thought behind every Sass language decision, with a big emphasis on clarity over customization (a big reason why Sass doesn't allow for custom properties like [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/) does). With the new [ECMAScript 2015 spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) that was released in June of last year, there were a lot of new featured added to the JavaScript language that too made it more clear and less convoluted to use.

While most browsers still don't yet [support](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) ES2015, you can use a transpiler, like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to convert the code into compatible ES5. The precompile step (yes, I know they're not exactly the same) is only the beginning of the similarities of the two languages. There are a lot of Sass features now implemented in ES2015 that you might not realize you have familiarity with as a Sass developer, and visa versa about Sass if you're a JavaScript developer.

*Let's take a look at 6 new ECMAScript features:*

## 1. Template String Interpolation

This ES2015 feature is the first time I realized how similar the two specs were. The string interpolation is almost identical (and it made me smile a lot). Basically, ES2015 introduced an *awesome* new inherent string templating feature based on back-ticks.

<aside class="half--right">
  Wow. <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/interpolation">Dictionary.com's definition</a> of <b>interpolation</b> really sucks. In this case, it's basically a way to reference your string variable in terms of its real value.
</aside>

This means you no longer need to use an external templating engine for basic strings and static DOM manipulation (in many cases). Which is great! And allows for more uniformity among code bases.

It looks like this &mdash; instead of:

```js
"First Name: " + fName + "\nLast Name: " + lName
```

You can simply write:

```
`First Name: ${fName}
Last Name: ${lName}`
```

This is *just* like Sass! Keep in mind, in Sass, variables look like this: `$varName`, and because that `$` is already taken, it uses a `#` to denote interpolation.

<div class="half--left highlight">
<pre>
<code class="language-js hljs">//.js
`variable: ${varName}`
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="half--right highlight">
<pre><code class="language-scss hljs">//.scss
"variable: #{$varName}"
</code></pre>
</div>

String interpolation is super handy when writing Sass mixins and writing any sort of output (i.e. via the CSS content property) to the DOM. We'll see in a later example (maps) why this is so crucial and common to use in Sass development.

## 2. Argument Defaults

Argument defaults are *so* useful when it comes to making functions (and mixins in the case of Sass!) more flexible. In the past, I've used them a *lot* in Sass to give a *pre-determined default argument value* in a function or mixin, giving the option to write your own value or to leave it out and accept the default. And now, you can also do this in JavaScript!

When instantiating your function, you can set your variable to a default value right in the argument list (just like Sass). In JavaScript, this is done with :

<div class="half--left highlight">
<pre>
<code class="language-js hljs">//.js
function sayHello(recipient = "beautiful") {
  return "Hello" + recipient;
}

sayHello();
sayHello("sunshine");
</code></pre>

<pre>
<code class="language-css hljs">/*console*/

> Hello beautiful
> Hello sunshine
</code>
</pre>

</div>

<div class="half--right highlight">
<pre><code class="language-scss hljs ">//.scss

@mixin showOutline($color: #f00) {
  outline: 1px solid $color;
}

.one {
  @include showOutline()
}

.two {
  @include showOutline(#ccc)
}
</code></pre>

<pre>
<code class="language-css hljs">/*css ouput*/

.one {
  outline: 1px solid #f00;
}

.two {
  outline: 1px solid #ccc;
}
</code>
</pre>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"></div>

Also as in Sass, it is important to note that any arguments with default values must follow arguments which do not have a default. If you think about the *why* of this rule, you can easily see how if you had an optional argument that followed a mandatory one, it would break if you left the mandatory one blank.

<div class="clearfix"></div>

## 3. Rest Parameters

On a similar thread of function/mixin arguments, *rest parameters* in ES2015 are a lot like the *arglist* argument types in Sass! Rest parameters (like arglist) must be the last value of a series of arguments when instantiating a function.

Rest parameters are created when using the [spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator) (`...`) in a function definition, causing it to behave [differently](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters) than when it is inside of functions of arrays.

You use arglists or rest parameters when there is an **indeterminate input length**. For example, in Sass, this is commonly used for *box shadows* or *gradients*. In JavaScript, rest parameters are denotes with the `...` *before* the argument, and in Sass, they come *after* the argument:

<div class="half--left highlight">
<pre>
<code class="language-js hljs">//.js
function PrintMe(firstArg, ...theRest) {
  console.log(firstArg, theRest);
}

PrintMe('Hello', 'You', 'Look', 'Nice');
</code></pre>

<pre>
<code class="language-css hljs">/*console*/

> Hello ["You", "Look", "Nice"]
</code>
</pre>
</div>

<div class="half--right highlight">
<pre><code class="language-scss hljs ">//.scss
@mixin funCircle($size, $gradient...) {
  width: $size;
  height: $size;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background: radial-gradient($gradient);
}

.entrancing {
  @include funCircle(50px, blue 10%, red 80% ,pink);
}
</code></pre>

<pre>
<code class="language-css hljs">/*css output*/
.entrancing {
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background: radial-gradient(blue 10%, red 80%, pink);
}
</code>
</pre>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"></div>

In both situations, the arglist/rest parameter values were bucketed and returned together when expected without breaking anything.

## 4. The "for-of" Loop

The [new looping](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/04/es6-in-depth-iterators-and-the-for-of-loop/) structure for arrays in ES2015 is very similar to the looping structure in Sass. ES2015 introduced the *for-of* loop. You may be wondering, *how does this differ from for-in?* First of all, it refers to the array **value**, not the array **index**.

Secondly, one of the problems with *for-in* is that you can't break out of or return from a *for-in* loop. This is because the *for–in* loop lets you for looping over object properties, while the more flexible *for–of* loop lets you loop over data—like the values in an array.

With Sass, the looping of anything works the same way as `for-of`, whether that be a map or a list, or a list of lists.

<div class="half--left highlight">
<pre>
<code class="language-js hljs">//.js

let colorArray = ["red", "yellow", "green"];

for (let color of colorArray) {
  console.log(color);
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="half--right highlight">
<pre><code class="language-scss hljs ">//.scss

$colorList: "red", "yellow", "green";

@each $color in $colorList {
  @debug $color;
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"></div>

If I used `for (let color in colorArray)` (**in** instead of **of**) the result would be *1, 2, 3* instead of *red, yellow, green*. In Sass, a `@debug` statement (shown above for brevity), is most similar to `console.log`, though, you could also `@return` values this way. However, these loops are most commonly used for generating multiple classes and styles. For example, if instead of `@return $color;` I had `.#{$color} { color: #{$color}}` (see string templating above) it would generate 3 classes (red, yellow, and green) which each set the color property to match their respective names.

## 5. Maps

--- get someone who knows maps better than me in JS to read this and make sure it makes sense ---

The latest ECMAscript Spec provides us with a new data structure: maps! Maps are excellent for [configuration](http://hugogiraudel.com/2014/05/05/bringing-configuration-objects-to-sass/) and allow access to their elements in `key : value` pairs. *How is this different from objects?* Good question. With objects, the *keys* are always converted into strings. This can cause problems with overriding values. With [maps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map), objects as values (or any other type of value) is not converted. You should still use objects when mixing value types and when you know all of the values before runtime, but maps are really useful otherwise.

Maps are also iterable! So you can use the same syntax as shown above (for *for-of* loop) to obtain values (which is also doable in Sass!).

<div class="half--left highlight">
<pre>
<code class="language-js hljs">//.js

let colorMap = new Map();

colorMap.set("primary", "red");
colorMap.set("secondary", "yellow");
colorMap.set("tertiary", "green");

for (let [key, value] of colorMap) {
  console.log(`key: ${key}, value: ${value}`);
}
</code></pre>

<pre>
<code class="language-css hljs">/*console*/

> key: primary, value: red
> key: secondary, value: yellow
> key: tertiary, value: green
</code>
</pre>
</div>

<div class="half--right highlight">
<pre><code class="language-scss hljs ">//.scss

$colorMap: (
  "primary": "red",
  "secondary": "yellow",
  "tertiary": "green"
);


@each $key, $value in $colorMap {
  .color--#{$key} {
    color: #{$value};
  }
}
</code></pre>

<pre>
<code class="language-css hljs">/*css output*/
.color--primary {
  color: red;
}

.color--secondary {
  color: yellow;
}

.color--tertiary {
  color: green;
}

</code>
</pre>

</div>

<div class="clearfix"></div>

<figcaption><a href="http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html">Sass map functions</a> are surprisingly robust.</figcaption>
</figure>

You may have noticed that I am using that *interpolation syntax* in the Sass example. This is because if I don't, Sass will output a string in the result: `color: "green"` instead of `color: green` (which wouldn't work in CSS).

You can also use Sass (as well as JS) to delete from maps, merge, zip, etc. They are a really nice way to organize code, from object information to colors to z-indices.

<div class="clearfix"></div>

## 6. Class Extends

Last but not least, ES2015 brings us classes (well, not real classes, but a bit of syntactic sugar over prototypes that let us pretend to write classes). With classes come `extends`! (Sound familiar yet?)

They work *very* similarly to the Sass `@extend` directive. In Javascript, `extends` allows you to create a new class which inherits the methods and properties from its parent class. (Then, the `super()` method allows access to the new class' parent methods). For example, in the case of `class Corgi extends Dog`), `Corgi` can access `Dog`'s `bark()` method with `super.bark()`.

You can also run this in the constructor to instantiate *all* of the parent's methods. Doing this allows `extends` to work like `@extend`!

Confused? It's easier to show:

<div class="half--left highlight">
<pre>
<code class="language-js hljs">//.js
class Dog {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  bark(words) {
    console.log(`WOOF!!! ${words} WOOF!`);
  }
}

class Corgi extends Dog {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }

  waddle() {
   // corgi waddle
  }
}

//Steve is a cori
let steve = new Corgi;

//Steve can bark like a Dog
steve.bark('I like bacon!')

//AND Steve can waddle, too!
</code></pre>

<pre>
<code class="language-css hljs">/*console*/

> WOOF!!! I like bacon! WOOF!
</code>
</pre>
</div>

<div class="half--right highlight">
<pre><code class="language-scss hljs ">//.scss
.plain-link {
  font-weight: 600;
  text-decoration: none;
  border-bottom: 2px dotted currentColor;
}

.pink-link {
  @extend .plain-link;
  color: hotpink;
}

.blue-link {
  @extend .plain-link;
  color: blue;
}
</code></pre>

<pre>
<code class="language-css hljs">/*css output*/
.plain-link, .pink-link, .blue-link {
  font-weight: 600;
  text-decoration: none;
  border-bottom: 2px dotted currentColor;
}

.pink-link {
  color: hotpink;
}

.blue-link {
  color: blue
}
</code>
</pre>

</div>

<div class="clearfix"></div>

What's going on in the Sass here is a key difference between `@extend` and `@include` for mixins. With `@extend` we're grabbing all of the styles from `.plain-link` and sharing those among each element which is *extending* it &mdash; akin to the JS methods being pulled from the parent class in the JavaScript example. We are then applying unique properties (in the case of Sass, the color; in the case of JavaScript, the waddle method), that are not available in the parent, but are available in the child classes that are extending it.

<aside>I've written all about `@extend` and how I use them systematically in Sass <a href="/classy-css">here</a> for the curious.</aside>

While some of these aren't perfect comparisons, there are real connections between Sass and JavaScript at play, especially with some of these new ES2015 features.
