...well not exactly, but there are a lot of similarities. While learning about the ES2015, the [latest JavaScript specification](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/), I came upon a few features which were new to the language, that I recognized from Sass.

--> Sass
  --> a lot of thought behind language decisions
  --> ruby based
--> you need to still precompile w/Babel

  #twitter-widget-0 {
    display: block;
    margin: 0 auto 1em;
  }

Here are 3 things new in ES2015 that you may already be implementing in Sass:

- maps, classes, interpolation, constructors
- template strings
- argument defaults
