This is part of a series of posts breaking down visual effects using CSS filters and blend modes. Read [Part 1: The Vintage Washout Effect](/vintage-washout), [Part 2: 3d Glasses](/3d-effect), [Part 3: Vignettes](/vignettes), and [Part 4: Bokeh Textures](/bokeh) for some background on blend modes and filters. In this post we'll explore a relatively new photography technique founded in Austria in the early 90's, called Lomography.

## A Little Background on Lomography

Lomography (AKA Lomo) was based on and inspired by a cheap Russian toy camera, Lomo LC-A. These photos are often high contrast with vignettes and soft focus. The original lomo cameras are the LC-A, Holga, Fisheye, Colorsplash and Supersampler <sup><a href="http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/what-is-lomography/">1</a></sup>. These cameras were originally considered "low quality" and created distorted images.

So, Lomography is very saturated, sometimes blurred, and contains unexpected light leaks. Hmm.. sounds suspiciously like things we can do in CSS!

## Playing with Filters

--> saturation, contrast

## Blur within the lines

--> Blur the image but keep edges crisp

## Light Leaks

--> blend mode: color and random gradient patches on the image

## Double Exposure
