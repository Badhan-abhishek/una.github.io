This is part of a series of posts breaking down visual effects using CSS filters and blend modes. Read [Part 1: The Vintage Washout Effect](/vintage-washout) for some background on the lighten blend mode and to learn how to make a nice faded photo effect.

## The Dark Side

In the last [post](/vintage-washout) in this series, I took a look at the **lighten** blend mode. In this post, we'll take a look at its evil twin -- the **darken** blend mode.

Okay, why do I call it the evil twin? Well let's take a look at what's going on here. The blend mode is only applied to the top color:

![normal, lighten and darken blend modes](../images/posts/css-effects/2/blendmodes--list.png)

<p class="caption">I added a grey background this time to better visualize the lightened item.</p>

So, what happens when you apply a lighten blend mode on top of a darken blend mode? **They intersect and cancel out!** This is also true with multiply/screen and color-burn/color-dodge because the way that the math is applied is an inverse of the other.

![intersecting blend modes](../images/posts/css-effects/2/blendmodes--lightendarken.png)

In this visualization, the numbers correspond with layer order. You can see that when the blue circle in lighten mode and the blue circle in darken mode intersect, they cancel out to return to their original blue color as though there were no blend mode applied at all.

## 3D Images

Okay, so what does that have to do with 3D images? *Everything!* If our intersecting pixels cancel-out to black, the original image pixel values are shown.

We can now use a bit of intersection to show the original image, and combine it with what we learned last week about how to determine shadow colors to create a 3D effect!

<img style="max-width: 600px" src="../images/posts/css-effects/2/3D-Avatar-movie.jpg" alt="" class="right">

If you look at these images, there is a **red layer**, a **cyan layer**, and they are separated on either side of the original image by a certain distance value (we will use `$dist` for this value in the example `@mixin` below). So the steps for this are to use cyan and red as multiply backgrounds and blend those background with `background-blend-mode: lighten` to convert the dark tones to the respective colors. Then, we will position these elements a set distance apart from each other.

<img style="max-width: 600px" src="../images/posts/css-effects/2/color-modes.jpg" alt="" class="left">

Now it's not *quiet* that simple &mdash; but we are in luck. Keep in mind that we're working in the **CMYK** color space. If we used a cyan and *yellow* instead of the cyan and red, the overlap would be *green* instead of the black to represent the original pixel value. The closer the value is, the better. The values that will mix best in this situation are the pure RGB values like red `rgb(255, 0, 0)`, green `rgb(0, 255, 0)`, and blue `rgb(0, 0, 255)`, but cyan `rgb(0,255,255)` also works.


## Blending the Blend Modes

So lets use cyan and red. At this point it looks like this (with an additional outline added for clarity):

<p data-height="490" data-theme-id="5255" data-slug-hash="MapmeJ" data-default-tab="result" data-user="una" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/una/pen/MapmeJ/'>3D Effect 1</a> by Una Kravets (<a href='http://codepen.io/una'>@una</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

This is where the magic of blend mode math comes in! Now we simply apply a *darken* blend mode to the top layer (the red) so that it cancels out with the lower layer (cyan) at areas in which is it overlapping the same pixel values! That means that the spread distance will show the respective colors (cyan and red) on either side since the pixels do not align exactly. This should explain with a visual animation:

<p data-height="487" data-theme-id="5255" data-slug-hash="epvReb" data-default-tab="result" data-user="una" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/una/pen/epvReb/'>3D Effect Part 2</a> by Una Kravets (<a href='http://codepen.io/una'>@una</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

I'm going to desaturate it a bit and get rid of those outlines:

<p data-height="495" data-theme-id="5255" data-slug-hash="bVqRLY" data-default-tab="result" data-user="una" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/una/pen/bVqRLY/'>3D Effect Part 3</a> by Una Kravets (<a href='http://codepen.io/una'>@una</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

If the internet connection to codepen or blend modes are not working for you, it looks like this:

## Live Example

<figure class="threeD-effect">
</figure>

<style contenteditable class="live-code">/* you can edit me!
there are some nice effects if you
play around with colors
(like lightgreens and purples)
*/

.threeD-effect {
  margin: 30px auto 0;
  display: block;
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  -webkit-filter: saturate(0.75);
          filter: saturate(0.75);
  z-index: 1;
  background: url('../images/posts/css-effects/2/robot.jpg'), cyan;
  background-blend-mode: lighten;
  background-size: cover;
}
.threeD-effect:after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  z-index: 2;
  background: url('../images/posts/css-effects/2/robot.jpg'), red;
  background-blend-mode: lighten;
  margin-left: 5px;
  background-size: cover;
  mix-blend-mode: darken;
}
</style>

## @mixin time

Sass (.scss)

```
@mixin three-dee($img, $dist: 5px, $width: 100%, $height: 500px) {
    z-index: 1;
    width: $width;
    height: $height;
    position: relative;
    background: url('#{$img}'), cyan;
    background-blend-mode: lighten;
    background-size: cover;

  &:after {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    display: block;
    width: $width;
    height: $height;
    z-index: 2;
    margin-left: $dist;
    background: url('#{$img}'), red;
    background-blend-mode: lighten;
    background-size: cover;
    mix-blend-mode: darken;
  }
}

.cats-in-action {
  @include three-dee('img/cat.jpg', 5px, 800px, 600px);
}
```

CSS Output:

```css
.cats-in-action {
  z-index: 1;
  width: 800px;
  height: 600px;
  position: relative;
  background: url("img/cat.jpg"), cyan;
  background-blend-mode: lighten;
  background-size: cover;
}
.cats-in-action:after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  display: block;
  width: 800px;
  height: 600px;
  z-index: 2;
  margin-left: 5px;
  background: url("img/cat.jpg"), red;
  background-blend-mode: lighten;
  background-size: cover;
  mix-blend-mode: darken;
}
```
