Exciting news! Microsoft sent me a [Surface Book](https://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/productID.5072642200?VID=5072761900) to test out developing on Windows. Microsoft didn't pay me (other than sending the product) or ask me to say anything in particular other than to share my thoughts and experience with you all. This is coming at a time when a lot of people (myself included) were a little disappointed in the Apple Macbook update (which removed the USB ports, headphone jack, and added only a bar on the keyboard).

In tech, we live so much in this Apple-land while our users are not largely on the same systems we're on. 55.72% of my blog's mobile audience is on Apple devices, and this number is trending downward. The other almost half are on a mix of other products and devices. I only have mobile data but I imagine desktops are just as varied. So I'm really grateful to have the opportunity to test out this device and build empathy for an audience on another system.

This post is an overview of my initial thoughts, going from a Mac-based environment (6 years of Macbooks!) to a Windows-based environment. I will say, [alternativeto.com](http://alternativeto.com) was my best friend. And I did find a lot of alternatives to the conveniences I'm used to in my development environment on my Macbook.

# Initial Thoughts

The hardware is pretty üî•üî•üî•. Compared to the Macbook, it feels *very* innovative. I love that the screen is detachable. I love the touchscreen. I love the face-detection login. It immediately made me realize how far behind Apple is on innovating their laptop line.

--> apple is more reliable (some connectivity issues)

--> face detection login is amazing

## Things I'm Loving
