To be honest, this year was pretty hard for me. And it wasn't just the political climate: I had a lot going on that made it difficult to care about side projects and blog posts as much. But I'm really hopeful next year will be better üôèüèº

A ski trip to Colorado in February was the begining of a long list of problems that I'm still dealing with today, which have drained a lot of my time and energy. I'll spare you the details in this overview, but you can <button class="more-info-trigger" data-a11y-toggle="more-info">click here to read more about it if you want Ô∏è‚¨áÔ∏è</button>

<div id="more-info">
  <p>So far, my insurance has been billed over $105,000 for a 1.5 hour outpatient surgery + 6 months of (ongoing) physical therapy (I'm lucky and have decent insurance so I only have to pay a portion of that, but it was still a not-fun unexpected expense).</p>

    <figcaption>I have a pretty gnarly scar now, that hasn't faded much yet.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>I was told surgery was my only option, but waited until June so that I could do some traveling and speaking before starting an intense recovery process that has now had me seeing 6 different physical therapists, an acupuncurist, a pain management doctor, and my surgeon regularly. I've tried active relase therapy, graston technique, cupping, laser therapy, ultrasound therapy, stretching, exercise, resting/icing, acupuncture, and even steroid injections, and none of it is helping this new post-surgical knee pain that is always there.</p>
  <p>So, this has been my life since June‚Äîfighting with my insurance company and dealing with knee pain. I spend a lot of time in physical therapy, and the whole ordeal has drained a lot of my physical and emotional energy. I was writing a book for half the year that I just dropped. I haven‚Äôt written as many blog posts or attended as many community events or started as many new projects, and stopped contributing to many of the ones I had started in the past. Maybe you can understand why I wasn't as productive this year.</p>

Despite all of that, a lot of good things happened too, and I recognize that I‚Äôm really lucky and privileged to be in the position I am in today:

- üèô I started to settle into a new city (New York City)
- üë∞üèª I was the maid of honor in my best friend's wedding
- üéµ I was gifted a ukulele from a really good friend after my ski accident, and consequently learned to play it (and started writing music)
- üìà I started investing in stocks & bitcoin, and taking a more careful look at my savings and finances
- üéì I got a promotion at [work](http://digitalocean.com) to Senior UI Engineer!
- ‚úèÔ∏è I started [bullet journaling](https://www.instagram.com/unadoestype/)
- üìö I read (i.e. listened to) **35 Books**. I loved so many of them, but if I had to choose only 6, my favorite from a variety of genres were:
    - *Love Star* by Andri Snaer Magnason
    - *The Design of Everyday Things* by Donald A. Norman
    - *Solve for Happy* by Mo Gawdat (get the audiobook!)
    - *Prisoners of Geography* by Tim Marshall
    - *The Time Traveler's Wife* by Audrey Niffenegger
    - *Sapiens* by Yuval Noah Harari

## Projects

I recorded **25 podcast episodes** of [Toolsday](https://toolsday.io) with over **125,000 downloads** this year. *And* have exciting news that Toolsday is joining the [Spec.FM Network](https://spec.fm/) next year! I also wrote **9 blog posts** (including this one), on topics ranging from [service workers](https://una.im/save-offline/) to [CSS grid](https://una.im/css-grid/) to [image micro-optimizations](https://css-tricks.com/contrast-swap-technique-improved-image-performance-css-filters/).

I made **490** contributions this year and built an [ASL Slack Bot](https://github.com/una/asl-bot), converted the [Toolsday](http://www.toolsday.io/) site to CSS grid and played with it on my [Travel Poetry Site](http://travels.surge.sh/jungfrau/). I started keeping my [Dev Doodles](https://www.instagram.com/dev_doodles/) consistent and in a single space, and prepared a script for a video series, as well as wrote over 60,000 words for a book. I also was a technical editor for [Addy Osmani's Essential Image Optimization E-Book](https://images.guide/).

I gave **17 talks** at **15 conferences** and **2 meetups** (and MC-ed 2 conferences ‚Äî one of which I preformed a song at üòÇ). My favorite new talks were:

## 25 Days Projects

I turned 25 this year, and wanted to do something to commemorate that ‚Äî so I chose 5 different projects that I would complete bit-by-bit every day. I ended up finishing 3 of the 5, including mentorship, dev doodles, and meditation. I wasn't able to finish letter writing and running.

## 2018: Collaboration

I noticed that my most enjoyable and consistent project this year was a collaboration (Toolsday). And I want to do more of that in the coming year. I loved being on Suz Hinton's Twitch stream, and I love working with other people to craft ideas and bring them to life. Having someone else work on projects with you keeps you accountable and makes it more fun. That's why I'm going to focus on **collaboration** as my "word" for 2018.
