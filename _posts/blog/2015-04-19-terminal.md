As a ~~designer or developer~~ person who builds things on a computer, the terminal is your best friend! But understandably, that big white or black box with a ticking pointer can appear very intimidating. Who knows what kind of damage trolls on the internet who are telling you to type commands into your terminal can do to your computer.

Education is key my friends. When you understand what some basic commands are doing, you can overcome terminal-dation (just go with it) and really improve your workflow!

If you're only using the terminal *sometimes* &mdash; maybe to run task runners (like [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) or [Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt)), and use Github, there are a few key commands that will help you with your workflow.

## Moving Around the Command Line
* `ctrl + A` will bring you to the beginning of your line. Forgot to add sudo? Don't wait to space through to the begining of your line, simply press `ctrl + A` and get there. Alternatively, `!!` repeats the last command, so you could type `sudo !!` to yield the same result
* `ctrl + E` puts the cursor at the end of the line.

## Controlling Processes
* `ctrl + Z` pauses a process. If you're running Gulp and commit your changes, you don't have to open a new tab. Just pause the process. Type `ctrl + Z`, and your terminal should allow entry for a new command. To see all of the paused processes, enter `jobs` &mdash; a command that will list all of the paused jobs. Resume the process with `fg`, which stands for *"foreground"*. It brings your job from the background to the foreground
* `ctrl + C` cancels a process. This is how you stop a process (such as Gulp). You will need to restart it
