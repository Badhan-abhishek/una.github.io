Intro

## What Are Promises and Why Do I Care?

Promises are used for [asynchronous](https://nodesource.com/blog/why-asynchronous/) functions or methods. Instead of events occuring in a single-threaded manner (one after the other), we are now writing JavaScript to implement multiple tasks at the same time (multi-threaded, i.e. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)). To do this, we implement [callback functions](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-callback-functions-and-use-them/) as arguments, and create "inter-threaded" (that's not a real term, the real term is *multi-threaded*) systems based on these callback functions that fire within other functions. This can get messy quickly. And that's exactly why promises were introduced in ES2015.

## The States of Promise

Every promise begins in the **pending** state and then is either **fullfilled** or **rejected** (never both).

Technically, all you *really* need for promises is `.then`. You pass two arguments to `then`: a *fullfillment handler* (what happens when the promise is fullfilled?), and a *rejection handler* (what happens when a promise is rejected?). If you *return* a value from your *fullfillment handler*, you get a *fullfilled* promise. if you *throw* a value from your *fullfillment handler*, your promise is rejected. You can chain these `.then` methods
