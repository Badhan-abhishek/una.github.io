subtitle: It's time for my annual reflection and goal resetting! It's been a crazy year for sure.
---

[Last year](http://una.im/2015-resolutions) I started a (now annual) tradition of reviewing my personal goals, and setting new ones. I can't believe how much has happened in the past year. It's definitely been a roller coaster, and I've definitely grown a ton as a person.

## 2015 Retrospective

Here are a few projects I've launched (all source code available on GitHub):

- [Sass Director](http://sassdirector.com/): A file generator for Sass partials that uses a single "director script" (aka your `main.scss`)
- [Gulp Starter Environment](https://github.com/una/gulp-starter-env): Created for the designers I worked with the learn gulp and get familiar with using Github.
- [Happy Moments](http://happy-moments.herokuapp.com): A node app that pulls in a single happy moment memory from each day I've had this year.
- [Travels](http://travels.surge.sh/): A web experiment site that uses filters and blend modes, featuring my travel poetry as content.
- [CSSgram](http://una.im/cssgram): A tiny CSS library recreating Instragram filters using just CSS features.
- [Toolsday](http://toolsday.io/): A 20-ish-minute podcast about the latest in tech tools, tips, and tricks (hosted along with my coworker, [Chris](https://twitter.com/chrisdhanaraj))
- [arttheweb.com](http://arttheweb.com/): A collection of my articles, talks, and web experiments based around designing in the browser.

That was all outside of work. At IBM, I worked on two large-scale pattern libraries (one for Watson and one for Bluemix), built prototypes for product iterations, and was very involved in building a Front-End Development community and curriculum.

### Knowledge Sharing

I've given **17** talks (and workshops) on Sass, UI interaction, performance optimizations, keyboard ninjary, open source design, goal setting, and CSS filters and blend modes. I've written **30** blog posts on topics ranging from very experimental (like [Generative Pixel Art](http://una.im/sass-pixel-art/) via Sass matrices and multi-blend-mode-cancelation hacks to create [Faux 3d Effects](http://una.im/3d-effect) to quiete practical ([5 Uses for Sass Maps](http://www.sitepoint.com/5-great-uses-sass-maps/) and a class-based [CSS architecture](http://una.im/classy-css/) system).

This is probably my favorite:

I also started doing code calligraphy as a way to create some mneumonic devices and solidify my skills. People on Twitter seemed to really resonate with them, so I want to continue to do these. A lot of people mentioned that they wanted prints, a book, or posters. I've got some ideas, but we'll see how it pans out with time. For now, I will just continue to visualize programming concepts in calligraphy and side remarks.

### Awards

Apparently people took notice, but didn't know where to categorize my contributions. I was nominated for [Young Designer of the Year](https://thenetawards.com/vote/young-designer/) while also getting on a list of [2015's Top JS Devs to Follow](http://blog.bithound.io/2015-top-js-devs/) and [Female Tech Influencers](http://skillcrush.com/2015/11/04/50-female-tech-influencers-to-follow-on-twitter/) ðŸ’ª.

### Personal Goals Outline

So how am I doing on those overall goals I laid out last year?




## 2016 Goals

### Professional Goals



### Personal Goals

First and foremost, after years of hackathons and conferences, I've come to realize that my wardrobe has now come to resemble that of a 20-year-old startup bro. Worse still is that I got comfortable wearing these tshirts and jeans every day ~~to work~~ everywhere. I want to dress better. And actually make time to go shopping :) that might help. Pinterest too.

I also want to get fit again (yes, I failed at this in 2015 &mdash; but I blame all of the travel). I started taking classes like aerials, which were awesome, and I want to continue those while also training for a **half-marathon**. Yes, it's going to suck at first, but hopefully I'll learn to love running again. I need to prioritize my health again.

My last personal goal from 2015 was to be better at keeping in touch with people I think I failed on that too. So

### 2016 Goals Overview

I'm cutting this down to fewer goals than last years.

In conclusion: 2015 was way more about professional development than personal development, and I want so badly to make 2016 more about personal development, but I have so many professional goals and I'm so young. I'm going to try to do it all. Wish me luck.
