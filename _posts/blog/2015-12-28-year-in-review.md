subtitle: It's time for my annual reflection and goal resetting! It's been a crazy year for sure.
---

[Last year](http://una.im/2015-resolutions) I started a (now annual) tradition of a pretty thorough "Year in Review" of my goals, and setting new ones. I can't believe how much has happened in the past year. It's been a real roller coaster, and I've definitely grown a ton as a person.

## 2015: In Review

Here are a few projects I've launched (all source code available on GitHub):

- [Sass Director](http://sassdirector.com/): A file generator for Sass partials that uses a single "director script" (aka your `main.scss`)
- [Gulp Starter Environment](https://github.com/una/gulp-starter-env): Created for the designers I worked with the learn gulp and get familiar with using Github.
- [Happy Moments](http://happy-moments.herokuapp.com): A node app that pulls in a single happy moment memory from each day I've had this year.
- [Travels](http://travels.surge.sh/): A web experiment site that uses filters and blend modes, featuring my travel poetry as content.
- [Toolsday](http://toolsday.io/): A 20-ish-minute podcast about the latest in tech tools, tips, and tricks (hosted along with my coworker, [Chris](https://twitter.com/chrisdhanaraj))
- [arttheweb.com](http://arttheweb.com/): A collection of my articles, talks, and web experiments based around designing in the browser.

### Knowledge Sharing

I've given **16(!)** talks (and workshops) on Sass, UI interaction, performance optimizations, keyboard ninjary, open source design, goal setting, and CSS filters and blend modes. I've written **30(!)** blog posts on topics ranging from very experimental (like [Generative Pixel Art](http://una.im/sass-pixel-art/) via Sass matrices and multi-blend-mode-cancelation hacks to create [Faux 3d Effects](http://una.im/3d-effect) to quiete practical ([5 Uses for Sass Maps](http://www.sitepoint.com/5-great-uses-sass-maps/) and a class-based [CSS architecture](http://una.im/classy-css/) system).

This is probably my favorite:

At work, within IBM, I worked on two large-scale pattern libraries (one for Watson and one for Bluemix), built prototypes for product iterations in the browser, and was very involved in building a Front-End Development community and curriculum.

### Awards

I was nominated for [Young Designer of the Year](https://thenetawards.com/vote/young-designer/) while also getting on a list of [2015's Top JS Devs to Follow](http://blog.bithound.io/2015-top-js-devs/) and [Female Tech Influencers](http://skillcrush.com/2015/11/04/50-female-tech-influencers-to-follow-on-twitter/) ðŸ’ª.
