This is part of a series of posts breaking down visual effects using CSS filters and blend modes. Read [Part 1: The Vintage Washout Effect](/vintage-washout), [Part 2: 3d Glasses](/3d-effect), and [Part 3: Vignettes](/vignettes) for some background on blend modes. In this post we'll explore a populat photography technique called bokeh and how to recreate the illusion of a bokeh-style image.

## So What is Bokeh?

</figure>

Bokeh is a photography technique that creates intentional blur for visual effect. The name itself stems from the Japanese word for blur or haze: boke. <sup><a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/127591-what-is-bokeh-here-s-the-photography-effect-explained">1</a></sup> Technically, any image with a blur in it can be considred bokeh, but they are most distinguished by the imagery of large circluar forms on photographs.

Christmas lights are popularly used to get this effect, and so are night scenes. Often, bokeh photography is simple round shapes, but can also include subjects in the foreground. Let's look into how we can recreate the illusion of bokeh photography in CSS.

## Applying Texture

Let's start with some blend modes &mdash; particularly multiply and screen are going to be your friends when applying texture (also Google). All you really need to do is layer a texture on top of an image and `multiply` if the texture is white, or `screen` if the texture is on a black background. It's super easy!

<figure class="third">
  <div class="snow"></div><br>
  <figcaption>Snow overlay.</figcaption>
</figure>


<figure class="third">
  <div class="doggie snow-me"></div><br>

<div class="clearfix"></div>

See, aren't blend modes fun? ðŸ˜Š There are so many textures you can play with. Just Google search what you're looking for, and feel free to get carried away.

## CSS Gradients

CSS Gradients and box shadows are extremely powerful for creating a variety of [visualizations](http://a.singlediv.com/). We can leverage them for building custom bokeh effects, too!

## CSS Shapes

Now, we can also use CSS Shapes to create an outline
