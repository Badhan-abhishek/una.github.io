This is the final post in a series which down visual effects using CSS filters and blend modes. Read [Part 1: The Vintage Washout Effect](/vintage-washout), [Part 2: 3d Glasses](/3d-effect), [Part 3: Vignettes](/vignettes), [Part 4: Bokeh Textures](/bokeh), and [Part 5: Lomography](/lomo) for some background on blend modes and filters. Let's end the series with something short and sweet that has a lot of impact for minimal lines of code: the infrared photo effect.
