Icons! We see them all over the web, and they're essential to most pattern libraries and web design systems. I recently needed to implement such a system. It needed to be scalable and dynamically editable via CSS. The icons were to be used by many teams in many different applications, built with different frameworks and techniques. They needed to have the ability to be restyled, get cached, and be updated quickly and easily as more icons are added. Basically, the icon system needed to be really, really flexible. Awesome. *Challenge accepted.*

## Why SVG Icons?

There are basically two options we have when it comes to icon systems:

- Font/glyph icons
- CSS data URIs
- SVG icons

SVG icons are superior. I'm sorry &mdash; they are. SVG is scalable, widely-supported, and allows for much more flexibility and dynamic editing. This post isn't going to go in depth on the benefits of SVG icons over the other systems because [so](http://ianfeather.co.uk/ten-reasons-we-switched-from-an-icon-font-to-svg/) [many](http://www.sitepoint.com/icon-fonts-vs-svg-debate/) [others](https://medium.com/@webprolific/why-and-how-i-m-using-svg-over-fonts-for-icons-7241dab890f0) [have](https://css-tricks.com/icon-fonts-vs-svg/). Besides, Font icons and data URI's in content tags are a [hack](http://una.im/Internet-is-hacks/#üíÅ), while SVG icons represent visualizations in the format we expect without weird workarounds for breaking accesibility due to re-defining native DOM elements.

## Using SVG

Ok great. We're using SVG icons! But there are also a few ways to implement SVG into the DOM, each with their own pros and cons and varried ways to be applied.

The Easiest Way: `<img src="apple.svg">`

| Tables   |      Are      |  Cool |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| col 1 is |  left-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is |    centered   |   $12 |
| col 3 is | right-aligned |    $1 |

## Making it Dynamic

The one advantage of font icons, and why people have (and do) use them, is that they are really easy to make minor edits to with CSS (colors, interactions, etc.). When it comes to SVG, unless you are inlining the SVG, this becomes difficult. You can't simply reference an SVG element and be able to edits its paths. That is, unless you use the `<symbol>` tag to separate out icons, and the `<use>` tag to access them. *oOoOoh this is getting good.*

So when we're making our sprite sheet, it doesn't look like a CSS sprite sheet, using `<view>` and `<viewBox>` to determine what we see:

![../../images/posts/svg-icons/icons.png]

but more like an invisible illusion of icons. They're there -- they are just invisible.

## Making it Systematic

### SVG Sprites

The first step is to generate an SVG sprite. We're building a sprite for a few reasons:

1. Eliminate HTTP requests (with this singular asset)
*. Create a cacheable asset
*. Faster page load time because all of the above
*. Provide a "Single Source of Truth" to reference and link to

[This is the key to the post](https://github.com/jkphl/svg-sprite)

Even with a sprite there are so many options:

- Traditional CSS sprites for use as background images,
- CSS sprites with pre-defined <view> elements, useful for foreground images as well,
- inline sprites using the <defs> element,
- inline sprites using the <symbol> element
- and SVG stacks.

what the various options meant
really nice web page created for you
symbol sprite is what we wanted

Usage
HTML usage
CSS usage for editing the icons

Boilerplate
provide boilerplate for others to build their own SVG icon systems with

Caveats
- the SVG must be located on the same domain as your website
- CORS issues are a nightmare
- use polyfill for ie 9 -11
i if you have it hosted on a CDN, enable CORS (check this stuff)


\*To the tune of Greased Lightning\*
Why these icons are systematic,
they're automatic,
they're ultramatic,
Why it's SVG lightning.
