Icons! We see them all over the web, and they're essential to most pattern libraries and web design systems. I recently needed to implement such a system. It needed to be scalable and dynamically editable via CSS. The icons were to be used by many teams in many different applications, built with different frameworks and techniques. They needed to have the ability to be restyled, get cached, and be updated quickly and easily as more icons are added. Basically, the icon system needed to be really, really flexible. Awesome. *Challenge accepted.*

## Why SVG Icons?

There are basically two options we have when it comes to icon systems:

- Font/glyph icons
- CSS-based data URIs
- SVG icons

SVG icons are superior. I'm sorry &mdash; they are. SVG is scalable, widely-supported, and allows for much more flexibility and dynamic editing. This post isn't going to go in depth on the benefits of SVG icons over the other systems because [so](http://ianfeather.co.uk/ten-reasons-we-switched-from-an-icon-font-to-svg/) [many](http://www.sitepoint.com/icon-fonts-vs-svg-debate/) [others](https://medium.com/@webprolific/why-and-how-i-m-using-svg-over-fonts-for-icons-7241dab890f0) [have](https://css-tricks.com/icon-fonts-vs-svg/). Besides, Font icons and data URI's in content tags are a [hack](http://una.im/Internet-is-hacks/#üíÅ), while SVG icons represent visualizations in the format we expect without weird workarounds for breaking accesibility due to re-defining native DOM elements.

## SVG Icon Options

Ok great. We've decided on using SVG icons! But there more than a few ways to implement SVG into the DOM, each with their own pros and cons. I initially outlined the pros and cons of each, but it made this article way too long and out of scope. Some of the methods I considered include:

1. Inline SVG
* Using individual SVG's as `<img>`'s
* [SVG CSS Sprite](https://css-tricks.com/css-sprites/) accessed via `<view>`
* [SVG Symbol Sprite](https://css-tricks.com/svg-use-with-external-reference-take-2) accessed via `<use>`
* [SVG Stacked Sprite](http://simurai.com/blog/2012/04/02/svg-stacks/)

Ultimately I went with Method 4: the SVG Symbol Sprite because:

- Eliminate HTTP requests (with this singular asset)
- Create and use a cacheable asset
- Faster page load time because all of the above
- Provide a "Single Source of Truth" to reference and link to
- SVG properties are editable in CSS
- SVG is animatable in CSS or JS

I also went with using an *"external"* SVG sprite. I put external in quotes because the SVG must still be within the same site as it is used in to avoid security issues and cross-origin errors (the bane of my existance right now). But when it works, it means the SVG does not need to live in the head of the same document on which the icons are being used. There is a compatability issue for IE, but we'll get into a polyfill for that later.

## Making it Dynamic

Unfortunately, we can't simply reference an SVG element and be able to edits its paths (i.e. <code>&lt;img src="apple.svg" style="fill:green"&gt;</code> will not let you edit the color of the apple to make it green).

But the `<symbol>` method allows us to reference our SVG's as though they are inlined on the page! The `<symbol>` tag separates out icons, and the `<use>` tag allows access to them. *oOoOoh this is getting good.*

So when we're making our SVG sprite sheet, it doesn't look like an SVG CSS sprite sheet (where you are taking individual SVGs and using `<view>` and `<viewBox>` to determine what portion of the larger image we see:

![](../../images/posts/svg-icons/icons.png)

With `<symbol>`, the icons are more *symbolic*, if you will (pun totally intended). If you preview a *symbol-based SVG*, it will look blank, though all the icons are defined within `<defs>` as individual `<symbols>`'s. They're there &mdash; and ready for `<use>`-age.

## Making it Systematic

Alright. So this seemed to be the best approach, now how can we build it to be scaleable?

### Generating the Sprite

The first step is to generate an SVG sprite. Luckily, [Joschi Kuphal](https://twitter.com/jkphl) made an awesome tool called [SVG Sprite](https://github.com/jkphl/svg-sprite) which he also ported into Gulp with [gulp-svg-sprite](https://github.com/jkphl/gulp-svg-sprite).

The SVG Sprite tool is awesome. It provides options for all of the options mentioned above and even some additional niceties such as cache busting and building a reference page for you. The reference page is *awesome*! These are the options I set to generate the `<symbol>` sprite I needed:

```
// SVG Config
var config = {
  mode: {
    symbol: { // symbol mode to build the SVG
      render: {
        css: false, // CSS output option for icon sizing
        scss: false // SCSS output option for icon sizing
      },
      dest: 'sprite', // destination folder
      prefix: '.svg--%s', // BEM-style prefix if styles rendered
      sprite: 'sprite.svg', //generated sprite name
      example: true // Build a sample page, please!
    }
  }
};
```

You can also set style render to generate a stylesheet that helps size icons, but I remove those (set to false above) because I like the icon to take the size of it's parent. These styles also correlate with the prefix (i.e. `prefix: '.svg--%s'` above).

### Adding Icons

Every individual SVG icon is added into a base folder (I just used `svg/`). Another awesome advantage of SVG Sprite is that it respects a folder system for naming icons. What this means is, if my base folder is `svg/` anything within that folder can be referenced via its name, and anything within a folder gets prepended. Here's what I mean:

```scss
svg/
|-- bubbles.svg //sprite.svg#bubbles
|-- cog.svg     //sprite.svg#cog
|
|__ glasses/
    |-- martini.svg //sprite.svg#glasses--martini
    |__ wine.svg    //sprite.svg#glasses--wine

```

With that naming structure in mind, you can now teach your designers how to add icons to that folder and submit pull requests! Yay for efficiency!

### Reference Page

The auto-generated reference page is such a sweet bonus, and helps you keep track of icon options:

## Usage

In HTML, you need just 3 lines of code to reference your icons with:

```html
<svg>
  <use xlink:href="sprite.svg#glasses--wine"></use>
</svg>
```

You may then style this SVG in CSS. Make sure to give it a width and height (default is 100% of parent). If you turned on the stylesheet rendering options above, you can include or link to the generated stylesheet. It is best to edit these icons in CSS after adding a class to the `<svg>`. For example:

HTML:

```html
<svg class="icon--wineglass">
  <use xlink:href="sprite.svg#glasses--wine"></use>
</svg>
```

Sass:

```scss
.icon--wineglass {
  fill: red; // additional styling

  &:hover {
    fill: white; // styling on hover
  }
}
```

## Caveats

- the SVG must be located on the same domain as your website
- CORS issues are a nightmare
- use polyfill for ie 9 -11
i if you have it hosted on a CDN, enable CORS (check this stuff)
