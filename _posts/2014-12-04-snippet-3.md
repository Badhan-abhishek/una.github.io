Sometimes getting the correct combination of `#{}` and `""` and `+` can be confusing. It gets even more confusing when using characters like the `$`, which is used for Sass variable declarations. Let's take a look at what works, and what doesn't.

I recently jumped into an open source [material-ui](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui) Sass port of Google's [Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html). It looked great on the [outside](http://material-ui.com/#/) but once I got into the code... oh my.

```
.mui-text-full-black          { color: $full-black; }
.mui-text-dark-black          { color: $dark-black; }
.mui-text-light-black         { color: $light-black; }
.mui-text-min-black           { color: $min-black; }
.mui-text-full-white          { color: $full-white; }
.mui-text-dark-white          { color: $dark-white; }
.mui-text-light-white         { color: $light-white; }
```

I know, I know. We're just starting to refactor and color declarations are a mess. Yet I like the challenge of this refactor, and I've already learned some things, like **unquote!**

## Refactor v1 Solution

So, like I said, I was trying to match the above code, but write it cleaner. This was my temporary solution:

```
$mui-text-color-vars: full-black, dark-black, light-black, min-black, full-white, dark-white, light-white;

@mixin mui-text($color-name) {
  .mui-text-#{$color-name} {
    color: #{'$'}#{$color-name};
  }
}

@each $color in $mui-text-color-vars {
  @include mui-text($color);
};
```

What I kept trying to do was match the **color name** in the class name (NOT condoning this, by the way, just trying to start helping to clean up this code base). The biggest challenge here was how to use the color name two times &mdash; the second of which would be directly prepended with a `$` and no spaces to access the color variable.

## What Doesn't Work

Adding the `'$'` string to the interpolated `$color name` variable.

<pre class="syntax--scss code--half"><code>
color: '$' + '#{$color-name}'

</code></pre>
<pre class="syntax--css code--half"><code>
color: "$dark-black"

</code></pre>

And this surely didn't work either:

<pre class="syntax--scss code--half"><code>
color: "'$' + '#{$color-name}'"

</code></pre>
<pre class="syntax--css code--half"><code>
color: "'$' + 'dark-black'"

</code></pre>


## What Works

However, lets look at non-working solution #1 again. This would be fine if those pesky quotes weren't there. Introducing: `unquote()` &mdash; it works like it sounds. I had never heard of it before, and I thought it was a pretty cool [function](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/nex3/sass/Sass/Script/Functions:unquote) upon discovery. Using `unquote()` in sass will simply remove quotation marks.

<pre class="syntax--scss code--half"><code>
color: unquote('$' + '#{$color-name}')

</code></pre>
<pre class="syntax--css code--half"><code>
color: $full-black;

</code></pre>
<br>

You can also simply use interpolation around a `'$'` to append it directly to the variable `color-name`. The trick here is to know to put **quotation marks** around the `$` as to not confuse the preprocessor.

<pre class="syntax--scss code--half"><code>
color: #{'$'}#{$color-name}

</code></pre>
<pre class="syntax--css code--half"><code>
color: $full-black;

</code></pre>



## Next Steps

The next step would be to go in and convert all of the color variables to a map and fix each reference. That way, we wouldn't need to specify a list of color names.

We'll get there, people.
