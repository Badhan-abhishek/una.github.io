subtitle: Neuroscience plays a big roll in our design work. This post takes a look at Sensory Memory and how animations can increase product comprehension.
---

I'm a pretty big fan of delightful interactions and micro-animations in design. They not only enhance a user's experience by bringing joy, but they can also make a user experience measurably more fluid.


## Lets Talk About Neuroscience

Memory relies on three distinct processes: sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory.

### Sensory Memory

*Sensory Memory* is our unconscious ability to retain impressions of sensory stimuli (visual, auditory, taste, smell, and physical touch) after the original stimuli has ended. This happens automatically as stimuli is perceived and does not require conscious thoughts. [<sup>1</sup>](http://education-portal.com/academy/lesson/sensory-memory-definition-examples-types.html)

<blockquote class="right">Sensory memory degrades very quickly, typically in the region of 100 - 500 milliseconds after the perception of an item.</blockquote>

Humans evolved this sensory ability as a means to deal with situations that require quick reactions (i.e. immediately sensing dangerous situations like a fire or poisonous animal). We will react without objectively thinking through the next steps of the situation.


### Iconic Memory

Try this: *close your eyes for a moment*. You'll see a brief after-image of what you were just looking at. This can also describe why we can see a full circle when looking at a spinning rope. When spun faster than the length of our sensory memory, the visual after-image will connect. In contrast, when spun slowly, it shows a visual break in the circle.

**Iconic memory** is the visual system within sensory memory and has been described as the cause of this phenomenon: **Persistence of Vision** [<sup>2</sup>](https://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Persistence_of_vision.html), by which an afterimage is thought to persist for approximately 1/25 of a second on the retina. For example, look at an object in the room you are in now, and then close your eyes and visualize that object. The image you "see" in your mind is your iconic memory of that visual stimuli. [Examples of Iconic Memory](http://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-iconic-memory.html) Iconic memory is part of the visual memory system in addition to long-term memory and visual short-term memory. [<sup>3</sup>](http://psychology.about.com/od/iindex/f/iconic-memory.htm)

## Using Sensory Memory to Our Advantage

People are bad at remembering things &mdash; we just are (and this is why optimization and speed is so vital to our products). As Tammy Everts puts it, <quote>"our need for web speed is about neuroscience, not entitlement" [<sup>4</sup>](http://www.webperformancetoday.com/2012/03/21/neuroscience-page-speed-web-performance/)</quote>.

<a class="twitter-share quote">This sensory time is short and precious; as designers, we need to take advantage of it.</a>

<aside>Tammy's article is really, really good, by the way. I highly recommend it!</aside>

Luckily, with design as our tool, we can do just that. Lets look at animations. [Studies](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1599820) on cognitive load theory show that animated presentations which visually demonstrate a correlation between items significantly improved motivation and concentration levels without additional mental effort.

<a class="twitter-share quote">Basically, animations and transitions that visualize connecting views increase the chances that a user will remain on your site and understand the intended task more easily.</a>

### State Persistence Animation: SPA

Companies have recently started doing this with animations between visual states. I'd like to name this technique **State Persistence Animation** AKA **SPA**.
