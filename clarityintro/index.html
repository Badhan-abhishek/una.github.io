  <h2>Re-Architect it</h2>

  <p>I think its time to form a team,<br>
  Design systems, sounds like a dream,<br>
  But what base button style will we choose then?</p>

  <p>We’ll fight like this: that name won’t do,<br>
  I wanted BEM, you wanted SUIT,<br>
  “Can we use React Sketch.app?” but… we use Ember…</p>

  <p class="chorus">Architect it,<br>
  Rearchitect it,<br>
  Architect it,<br>
  Rearchitect it.</p>

  <p>Our vision's strong, but we need better docs,<br>
  ‘Cause nobody uses our code blocks,<br>
  This beautiful design system we built them,</p>

  <p>And by the time, they try to use,<br>
  The dropdown with <code>background: $blue-32</code>,<br>
  Its outdated because v3 was breaking.</p>

  <p class="chorus">The CDN’s down,<br>
  Sprite’s returning CORS now,<br>
  Where’s the focus state?<br>
  Did my hotfix land in the last update?</p>

  <p>Maybe its time, to just build a bot,<br>
  It’ll parse our app, make decisions for us,<br>
  Run tests and push a new release when finished,</p>

  <p>I’d love to go hang with my nerds in leu,<br>
  Argue quote styles, “React or Vue”,<br>
  How to say gif, and invent ourselves new titles,</p>

  <p class="chorus">At Clarity conf,<br>
  Clarity conf,<br>
  Clarity conf,<br>
  Welcome to Clarity </p>
